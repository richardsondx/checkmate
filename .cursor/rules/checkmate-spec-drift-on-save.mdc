# CheckMate · Spec‑vs‑Code Drift on Save

This rule monitors files for spec drift when they are saved, ensuring implementations stay aligned with specifications.

```rule type=activation
activationTrigger:
  event: file_save
  path: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.js", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]
  maxRuns: 1
```

```rule type=on_file_save
# Run spec drift detection script
checkmate run-script cm-spec-drift $FILE_PATH
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Possible spec drift detected. Implementation has diverged from spec."
else
  echo "✅ Spec drift check completed. No drift detected."
fi
```
