# CheckMate – Post‑Task Verification
- After coding, verify all affected specs.
- Execute: `checkmate run --target "$CM_LIST" --fail-early`
- If any bullet fails, stop at the first failing test and fix it.
- Continue fixing one test at a time until all pass.
- When all pass, reset boxes (CheckMate handles this internally).
