# CheckMate ¬∑ New Spec Creator

This rule captures when a user tries to manually create a spec file and helps them generate a proper template.

```rule type=activation
activationTrigger:
  event: file_create
  path: "checkmate/specs/**.md"
  maxRuns: 1
```

```rule type=on_file_create
# If this is a new file, offer to generate a template
if [ ! -s "$FILEPATH" ]; then
  FILENAME=$(basename "$FILEPATH")
  TITLE=${FILENAME%.md}
  
  # Display a notification
  echo "üß∞ CheckMate Spec Creator" 
  echo "üîç Detected new spec file: $FILEPATH"
  echo "üìù Do you want to generate a properly formatted spec template?"
  echo "   This will replace the current empty file with a template."
  echo ""
  echo "üîµ Run this command to create the spec:"
  echo "   node scripts/create-spec-template.js \"$TITLE\" --files=path/to/file1.js,path/to/file2.js"
  echo ""
  echo "‚úÖ Or use warmup to generate specs automatically from your codebase:"
  echo "   checkmate warmup"
fi
```

## Spec Creation Tips

This rule activates when you create a new .md file in the CheckMate specs directory. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use one of these methods to create properly formatted specs:

1. **Use the template generator:**
   ```
   node scripts/create-spec-template.js "Feature Title" --files=file1.js,file2.js
   ```

2. **Let CheckMate analyze your code:**
   ```
   checkmate warmup
   ```

3. **Generate from a feature description:**
   ```
   checkmate gen "Feature description"
   ```

All these methods ensure your spec has the correct structure and meta information.
