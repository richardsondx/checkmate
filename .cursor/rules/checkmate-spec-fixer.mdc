# CheckMate ¬∑ Spec Format Auto-Fixer

This rule automatically fixes CheckMate spec files that don't meet format standards.

```rule type=activation
activationTrigger:
  change:
    include: ["checkmate/specs/**.md"]
  maxRuns: 1
```

```rule type=on_change
# Auto-fix the spec format on save
if [[ "$FILEPATH" == *.md ]]; then
  # Check if file exists and is not empty
  if [ -s "$FILEPATH" ]; then
    echo "üîç Validating and auto-fixing spec format: $FILEPATH"
    
    # Run the validator with the fix flag
    checkmate run-script validate-spec-format "$FILEPATH" --fix

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "‚úÖ Spec format is valid or has been fixed"
    else
      echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Could not automatically fix all issues in $FILEPATH"
      echo "   Some manual corrections may be needed"
