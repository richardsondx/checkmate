# CheckMate CLI Improvements Progress Log

## Overview

This document tracks the improvements made to the CheckMate CLI to enable reliable conversion of natural language feature requests into actionable specs with testable checklists.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Core Pipeline Upgrades

- **Feature Splitter (src/lib/splitter.ts)**
  - Implemented a reasoning model-based feature splitter that breaks down complex requirements into distinct atomic features
  - Each feature has title, slug, and description properties
  - Added JSON parsing with fallback extraction for reliable model response processing
  - Wrote unit test in test-splitter.mjs

- **Context Builder (src/lib/context.ts)**
  - Created an intelligent file ranking system that finds files relevant to each feature
  - Implemented TF-IDF style keyword matching for better relevance scoring
  - Added support for scanning all files or just code files (--all-files flag)
  - Includes reasons for each file's relevance to aid spec creation

- **Spec Author (src/lib/specAuthor.ts)**
  - Implemented improved spec generation with detailed, testable requirements
  - Added support for additional context/notes from PRD or other sources
  - Created a structured output format with files section and steps checklist
  - Added "needsMoreContext" flag to indicate when more information would help

### 2. Command Enhancements

- **Generate Command (src/commands/gen.ts)**
  - Updated to use the new pipeline components
  - Added visual feedback with spinner during model reasoning
  - Shows clear progress for multi-feature generation
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing CLI usage

- **Create Command (src/commands/create.ts)**
  - Added new command for integration with external tools
  - Supports JSON payload input (--json) with feature, files, and notes
  - Supports PRD file input (--prd) to extract multiple features
  - Added spec update functionality (--update) to refresh existing specs

- **Affected Command (src/commands/affected.ts)**
  - Added Git-optional file difference tracking
  - Implemented filesystem snapshot-based change detection
  - Added JSON output option for programmatic use
  - Supports diffing against specific Git bases or latest snapshot

### 3. Git-Optional Infrastructure

- **File Tree Utilities (src/lib/tree.ts)**
  - Added Git-optional file scanning and change detection
  - Implemented file snapshot system with MD5 hashing
  - Created `.checkmate/snap.json` for tracking file changes
  - Improved file matching for spec dependencies

### 4. Configuration

- **Config Handling (src/lib/config.ts)**
  - Added new configuration options:
    - `context_top_n`: Maximum number of files to include in context (default: 40)
    - `show_thinking`: Whether to show model reasoning spinner (default: true)
  - Updated default model settings to use GPT-4o

### 5. Cursor Integration

- **Helper Script (scripts/cursor-checkmate.js)**
  - Created a helper script for easy invocation from Cursor
  - Allows passing feature description and specific files
  - Forwards to the new create command with JSON payload

- **README Updates**
  - Added documentation for working with Cursor
  - Included examples of one-off spec creation
  - Added guidance on using affected specs with JSON output

### 6. Dependency Updates

- Added support for:
  - `ora` for spinner/progress indicators
  - `chalk` for colorized output
  - `fast-glob` for efficient file scanning
  - `string-similarity` for relevance ranking
  - `tsx` for TypeScript execution

## Testing Results

The implementation successfully:
- Splits complex requirements like "Find by Issues and by Repositories" into distinct features
- Ranks files by relevance to each feature
- Generates detailed, testable specifications
- Works with or without Git for file tracking
- Shows clear progress with visual feedback
- Integrates cleanly with Cursor through multiple methods

## Production Readiness Notes

For full production deployment, the following issues need to be addressed:

1. **API Parameter Fix**: The OpenAI API parameters need to be updated for newer models:
   - We discovered during testing that newer models like GPT-4o require `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
   - This change has been implemented but would need thorough testing with a valid API key

2. **Error Handling**: 
   - Add more robust error handling for cases where:
     - OpenAI API is unavailable
     - The model doesn't generate valid JSON
     - Files cannot be read or written

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting and retry logic for API calls
   - Add queueing for large batches of spec generations

4. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Expand test suite to cover:
     - All new components
     - Integration between components
     - Edge cases with various input types

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - For larger codebases, optimize the context builder to use more efficient file scanning
   - Consider implementing caching for file contents to speed up relevance scoring

## Next Steps

- **Additional Testing**: Test with larger repositories to ensure performance
- **CI Integration**: Add GitHub Actions workflow for spec validation
- **UI Improvements**: Consider a web UI for spec visualization
- **PRD Integration**: Enhance PRD parsing to extract more structured requirements
