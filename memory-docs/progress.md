# CheckMate CLI Improvements Progress Log

## Overview

This document tracks the improvements made to the CheckMate CLI to enable reliable conversion of natural language feature requests into actionable specs with testable checklists.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Core Pipeline Upgrades

- **Feature Splitter (src/lib/splitter.ts)**
  - Implemented a reasoning model-based feature splitter that breaks down complex requirements into distinct atomic features
  - Each feature has title, slug, and description properties
  - Added JSON parsing with fallback extraction for reliable model response processing
  - Wrote unit test in test-splitter.mjs

- **Context Builder (src/lib/context.ts)**
  - Created an intelligent file ranking system that finds files relevant to each feature
  - Implemented TF-IDF style keyword matching for better relevance scoring
  - Added support for scanning all files or just code files (--all-files flag)
  - Includes reasons for each file's relevance to aid spec creation

- **Spec Author (src/lib/specAuthor.ts)**
  - Implemented improved spec generation with detailed, testable requirements
  - Added support for additional context/notes from PRD or other sources
  - Created a structured output format with files section and steps checklist
  - Added "needsMoreContext" flag to indicate when more information would help

### 2. Command Enhancements

- **Generate Command (src/commands/gen.ts)**
  - Updated to use the new pipeline components
  - Added visual feedback with spinner during model reasoning
  - Shows clear progress for multi-feature generation
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing CLI usage

- **Create Command (src/commands/create.ts)**
  - Added new command for integration with external tools
  - Supports JSON payload input (--json) with feature, files, and notes
  - Supports PRD file input (--prd) to extract multiple features
  - Added spec update functionality (--update) to refresh existing specs

- **Affected Command (src/commands/affected.ts)**
  - Added Git-optional file difference tracking
  - Implemented filesystem snapshot-based change detection
  - Added JSON output option for programmatic use
  - Supports diffing against specific Git bases or latest snapshot

### 3. Git-Optional Infrastructure

- **File Tree Utilities (src/lib/tree.ts)**
  - Added Git-optional file scanning and change detection
  - Implemented file snapshot system with MD5 hashing
  - Created `.checkmate/snap.json` for tracking file changes
  - Improved file matching for spec dependencies

### 4. Configuration

- **Config Handling (src/lib/config.ts)**
  - Added new configuration options:
    - `context_top_n`: Maximum number of files to include in context (default: 40)
    - `show_thinking`: Whether to show model reasoning spinner (default: true)
  - Updated default model settings to use GPT-4o

### 5. Cursor Integration

- **Helper Script (scripts/cursor-checkmate.js)**
  - Created a helper script for easy invocation from Cursor
  - Allows passing feature description and specific files
  - Forwards to the new create command with JSON payload

- **README Updates**
  - Added documentation for working with Cursor
  - Included examples of one-off spec creation
  - Added guidance on using affected specs with JSON output

### 6. Dependency Updates

- Added support for:
  - `ora` for spinner/progress indicators
  - `chalk` for colorized output
  - `fast-glob` for efficient file scanning
  - `string-similarity` for relevance ranking
  - `tsx` for TypeScript execution

### 7. Cursor Rule Files Enhancement

- **Added `.mdc` Rule Files Integration**
  - Created `src/lib/cursorRules.ts` to manage Cursor rule files
  - Enhanced `init` command to automatically generate `.mdc` rule files
  - Added three rule files following Cursor best practices:
    - `pre-task.mdc` - For scope analysis before coding
    - `post-task.mdc` - For verification after coding
    - `post-push.mdc` - For full suite testing on pushes
  - Made rule file generation idempotent to avoid overwriting customizations
  - Added documentation in README about the rule files and their purpose

### 8. Specification Format Improvements

- **Markdown Specs Structure Refinement**
  - Changed "Requirements" section to "Checks" for clarity and simplicity
  - Removed unnecessary "Notes" sections from markdown specs
  - Rewritten checks to focus on behavior rather than implementation details
  - Standardized format across all markdown specs

- **Comprehensive Architecture Documentation**
  - Created detailed architecture document explaining all system components
  - Documented data flow between components
  - Added diagrams for key processes
  - Included extension points and future directions

## Testing Results

The implementation successfully:
- Splits complex requirements like "Find by Issues and by Repositories" into distinct features
- Ranks files by relevance to each feature
- Generates detailed, testable specifications
- Works with or without Git for file tracking
- Shows clear progress with visual feedback
- Integrates cleanly with Cursor through multiple methods

## Production Readiness Notes

For full production deployment, the following issues need to be addressed:

1. **API Parameter Fix**: The OpenAI API parameters need to be updated for newer models:
   - We discovered during testing that newer models like GPT-4o require `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
   - This change has been implemented but would need thorough testing with a valid API key

2. **Error Handling**: 
   - Add more robust error handling for cases where:
     - OpenAI API is unavailable
     - The model doesn't generate valid JSON
     - Files cannot be read or written

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting and retry logic for API calls
   - Add queueing for large batches of spec generations

4. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Expand test suite to cover:
     - All new components
     - Integration between components
     - Edge cases with various input types

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - For larger codebases, optimize the context builder to use more efficient file scanning
   - Consider implementing caching for file contents to speed up relevance scoring

## Next Steps

- **Additional Testing**: Test with larger repositories to ensure performance
- **CI Integration**: Add GitHub Actions workflow for spec validation
- **UI Improvements**: Consider a web UI for spec visualization
- **PRD Integration**: Enhance PRD parsing to extract more structured requirements
- **Spec Format Consistency**: Implement coordinated update to align YAML "requirements" with markdown "checks":
  
  **Implementation Plan:**
  1. **Code Updates**:
     - Update `src/lib/specs.ts` to handle both "requirements" and "checks" fields in YAML parsing
     - Modify `parseYamlSpec` and `validateYamlSpecStructure` functions
     - Update the `Spec` interface to use a unified terminology
     - Add backward compatibility for old-format files

  2. **Promotion Tool**:
     - Update `src/commands/promote.ts` to use "checks" instead of "requirements" when generating YAML
     - Maintain compatibility with existing test code extraction logic

  3. **Test Updates**:
     - Update `test-spec-types.mjs` to test both formats during the transition
     - Add tests specifically for the format migration

  4. **Migration Script**:
     - Create `convert-specs.ts` utility to update all agent YAML files:
       ```typescript
       // Convert YAML format from requirements to checks
       function migrateSpecFile(filePath) {
         const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
         const data = parseYaml(content);
         if (data.requirements && !data.checks) {
           data.checks = data.requirements;
           delete data.requirements;
           
           // Also rename internal fields
           data.checks.forEach(check => {
             if (check.require && !check.check) {
               check.check = check.require;
               delete check.require;
             }
           });
           
           fs.writeFileSync(filePath, stringifyYaml(data), 'utf8');
           return true; // File was migrated
         }
         return false; // No migration needed
       }
       ```

  5. **Documentation**:
     - Update README and docs to reflect the new terminology
     - Add a note about the change in the CHANGELOG
     - Update examples to use consistent terminology

  6. **Rollout Strategy**:
     - Phase 1: Add support for reading both formats
     - Phase 2: Convert existing files with migration script
     - Phase 3: Update the spec creation to use new format only

### 9. LLM-Driven Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

- **Conceptual Shift**: Moved from CheckMate-as-verifier (running its own tests) to CheckMate-as-LLM-collaborator for TDD.
  - CheckMate now provides the checklist (spec items) and validates the LLM's reasoning about its own verification process.

- **New Core Commands for LLM TDD:**
  - `list-checks (src/commands/list-checks.ts)`:
    - Retrieves all check items from a specified spec file.
    - Assigns a simple, position-based ID (1, 2, 3...) to each check item.
    - Outputs in JSON (for LLM consumption) or human-readable text.
  - `verify-llm-reasoning (src/commands/verify-llm-reasoning.ts)`:
    - Takes a spec, a check ID (position), LLM-defined success/failure conditions, and the LLM's outcome report for that check.
    - Uses a reasoning model (e.g., GPT-4o) to determine if the LLM's outcome report logically satisfies its own success condition and avoids its failure condition.
    - Updates the status of the check item (pass/fail) in the Markdown spec file directly.
    - Provides feedback (PASS/FAIL reason) to the LLM.

- **Command Removals/Deprecations (reflecting new workflow):**
  - Removed `src/commands/run.ts`: LLM now drives execution; direct spec running by CheckMate is no longer the primary TDD loop.
  - Removed `src/commands/audit.ts`: `verify-llm-reasoning` + LLM self-assessment replaces the old audit logic.

- **Cursor Rule Enhancement (`.cursor/rules/checkmate-feature-validation-workflow.mdc`):**
  - Overhauled to orchestrate the new LLM-TDD flow.
  - When triggered (e.g., by user command `@checkmate-tdd <feature-slug>`):
    - Calls `list-checks` to get the checklist for the feature.
    - Presents the checks to the LLM.
    - Instructs the LLM to iterate through checks, define SC/FC, verify/implement code, create an outcome report, and then call `verify-llm-reasoning`.
    - The LLM uses feedback from `verify-llm-reasoning` to self-correct or proceed.

- **Spec ID Simplification:**
  - Moved from complex generated/embedded IDs in spec files to simple 1-based positional IDs for check items. This simplifies parsing and usage by the LLM.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - `README.md` and `memory-docs/architectures.md` updated to reflect the new workflow, commands, and data flow.
