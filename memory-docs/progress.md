# CheckMate CLI Improvements Progress Log

## Overview

This document tracks the improvements made to the CheckMate CLI to enable reliable conversion of natural language feature requests into actionable specs with testable checklists.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Core Pipeline Upgrades

- **Feature Splitter (src/lib/splitter.ts)**
  - Implemented a reasoning model-based feature splitter that breaks down complex requirements into distinct atomic features
  - Each feature has title, slug, and description properties
  - Added JSON parsing with fallback extraction for reliable model response processing
  - Wrote unit test in test-splitter.mjs

- **Context Builder (src/lib/context.ts)**
  - Created an intelligent file ranking system that finds files relevant to each feature
  - Implemented TF-IDF style keyword matching for better relevance scoring
  - Added support for scanning all files or just code files (--all-files flag)
  - Includes reasons for each file's relevance to aid spec creation

- **Spec Author (src/lib/specAuthor.ts)**
  - Implemented improved spec generation with detailed, testable requirements
  - Added support for additional context/notes from PRD or other sources
  - Created a structured output format with files section and steps checklist
  - Added "needsMoreContext" flag to indicate when more information would help

### 2. Command Enhancements

- **Generate Command (src/commands/gen.ts)**
  - Updated to use the new pipeline components
  - Added visual feedback with spinner during model reasoning
  - Shows clear progress for multi-feature generation
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing CLI usage

- **Create Command (src/commands/create.ts)**
  - Added new command for integration with external tools
  - Supports JSON payload input (--json) with feature, files, and notes
  - Supports PRD file input (--prd) to extract multiple features
  - Added spec update functionality (--update) to refresh existing specs

- **Affected Command (src/commands/affected.ts)**
  - Added Git-optional file difference tracking
  - Implemented filesystem snapshot-based change detection
  - Added JSON output option for programmatic use
  - Supports diffing against specific Git bases or latest snapshot

### 3. Git-Optional Infrastructure

- **File Tree Utilities (src/lib/tree.ts)**
  - Added Git-optional file scanning and change detection
  - Implemented file snapshot system with MD5 hashing
  - Created `.checkmate/snap.json` for tracking file changes
  - Improved file matching for spec dependencies

### 4. Configuration

- **Config Handling (src/lib/config.ts)**
  - Added new configuration options:
    - `context_top_n`: Maximum number of files to include in context (default: 40)
    - `show_thinking`: Whether to show model reasoning spinner (default: true)
  - Updated default model settings to use GPT-4o

### 5. Cursor Integration

- **Helper Script (scripts/cursor-checkmate.js)**
  - Created a helper script for easy invocation from Cursor
  - Allows passing feature description and specific files
  - Forwards to the new create command with JSON payload

- **README Updates**
  - Added documentation for working with Cursor
  - Included examples of one-off spec creation
  - Added guidance on using affected specs with JSON output

### 6. Dependency Updates

- Added support for:
  - `ora` for spinner/progress indicators
  - `chalk` for colorized output
  - `fast-glob` for efficient file scanning
  - `string-similarity` for relevance ranking
  - `tsx` for TypeScript execution

### 7. Cursor Rule Files Enhancement

- **Added `.mdc` Rule Files Integration**
  - Created `src/lib/cursorRules.ts` to manage Cursor rule files
  - Enhanced `init` command to automatically generate `.mdc` rule files
  - Added three rule files following Cursor best practices:
    - `pre-task.mdc` - For scope analysis before coding
    - `post-task.mdc` - For verification after coding
    - `post-push.mdc` - For full suite testing on pushes
  - Made rule file generation idempotent to avoid overwriting customizations
  - Added documentation in README about the rule files and their purpose

### 8. Specification Format Improvements

- **Markdown Specs Structure Refinement**
  - Changed "Requirements" section to "Checks" for clarity and simplicity
  - Removed unnecessary "Notes" sections from markdown specs
  - Rewritten checks to focus on behavior rather than implementation details
  - Standardized format across all markdown specs

- **Comprehensive Architecture Documentation**
  - Created detailed architecture document explaining all system components
  - Documented data flow between components
  - Added diagrams for key processes
  - Included extension points and future directions

### 9. LLM-Driven Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

- **Conceptual Shift**: Moved from CheckMate-as-verifier (running its own tests) to CheckMate-as-LLM-collaborator for TDD.
  - CheckMate now provides the checklist (spec items) and validates the LLM's reasoning about its own verification process.

- **New Core Commands for LLM TDD:**
  - `list-checks (src/commands/list-checks.ts)`:
    - Retrieves all check items from a specified spec file.
    - Assigns a simple, position-based ID (1, 2, 3...) to each check item.
    - Outputs in JSON (for LLM consumption) or human-readable text.
  - `verify-llm-reasoning (src/commands/verify-llm-reasoning.ts)`:
    - Takes a spec, a check ID (position), LLM-defined success/failure conditions, and the LLM's outcome report for that check.
    - Uses a reasoning model (e.g., GPT-4o) to determine if the LLM's outcome report logically satisfies its own success condition and avoids its failure condition.
    - Updates the status of the check item (pass/fail) in the Markdown spec file directly.
    - Provides feedback (PASS/FAIL reason) to the LLM.

- **Command Removals/Deprecations (reflecting new workflow):**
  - Removed `src/commands/run.ts`: LLM now drives execution; direct spec running by CheckMate is no longer the primary TDD loop.
  - Removed `src/commands/audit.ts`: `verify-llm-reasoning` + LLM self-assessment replaces the old audit logic.

- **Cursor Rule Enhancement (`.cursor/rules/checkmate-feature-validation-workflow.mdc`):**
  - Overhauled to orchestrate the new LLM-TDD flow.
  - When triggered (e.g., by user command `@checkmate-tdd <feature-slug>`):
    - Calls `list-checks` to get the checklist for the feature.
    - Presents the checks to the LLM.
    - Instructs the LLM to iterate through checks, define SC/FC, verify/implement code, create an outcome report, and then call `verify-llm-reasoning`.
    - The LLM uses feedback from `verify-llm-reasoning` to self-correct or proceed.

- **Spec ID Simplification:**
  - Moved from complex generated/embedded IDs in spec files to simple 1-based positional IDs for check items. This simplifies parsing and usage by the LLM.

### 10. Cursor Rules Consolidation and Cleanup

- **Rule Format Standardization**:
  - Converted all Cursor rules to use the `.mdc` format (Markdown-based Cursor rules) for consistency
  - Removed redundant JSON-format rules that duplicated functionality
  - Updated rule installation script to properly handle content types

- **Rule File Improvements**:
  - Created a more robust `checkmate-spec-naming-convention.mdc` rule to replace the unused JavaScript implementation
  - Ensured all MDC rules are properly installed during `checkmate init`
  - Removed outdated `audit-after-fix.md` rule that referenced removed commands

- **Setup Script Enhancements**:
  - Updated `setup-cursor-rules.js` to write MDC files as plain text rather than JSON
  - Added support for all essential rule files during initialization
  - Added proper file format detection with isJson flag

- **Documentation Improvements**:
  - Added comprehensive comments in rules to explain their purpose
  - Updated Cursor integration documentation to reflect current rule setup
  - Ensured all rule files follow consistent naming conventions and style

### 11. Specification Format Standardization

- **Simplified Format Structure**:
  - Removed complex `<!-- meta: ... -->` sections with file hashes in favor of a simple `## Files` section
  - Updated spec validator to make meta sections optional rather than required
  - Created migration script to automatically convert existing specs to the new format

- **Format Validator Improvements**:
  - Modified `validate-spec-format.js` to support the new simplified format
  - Made meta validation conditional on the presence of meta sections
  - Preserved backward compatibility for older spec formats

- **Migration Tools**:
  - Created `scripts/migrate/remove-meta-sections.js` to convert specs to the new format
  - Extracted file paths from meta sections and added them to the `## Files` section
  - Ensured clean removal of meta sections while preserving all relevant information

- **Benefits of Simplified Format**:
  - Better aligns with the LLM-driven TDD workflow where LLMs work directly with human-readable specs
  - Improves readability for both humans and LLMs
  - Reduces technical debt from maintaining complex file hash tracking
  - Makes it easier to create and edit specs manually

## Testing Results

The implementation successfully:
- Splits complex requirements like "Find by Issues and by Repositories" into distinct features
- Ranks files by relevance to each feature
- Generates detailed, testable specifications
- Works with or without Git for file tracking
- Shows clear progress with visual feedback
- Integrates cleanly with Cursor through multiple methods
- Validates LLM reasoning about implementation through the TDD workflow

## Production Readiness Notes

For full production deployment, the following issues need to be addressed:

1. **API Parameter Fix**: The OpenAI API parameters need to be updated for newer models:
   - We discovered during testing that newer models like GPT-4o require `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
   - This change has been implemented but would need thorough testing with a valid API key

2. **Error Handling**: 
   - Add more robust error handling for cases where:
     - OpenAI API is unavailable
     - The model doesn't generate valid JSON
     - Files cannot be read or written

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting and retry logic for API calls
   - Add queueing for large batches of spec generations

4. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Expand test suite to cover:
     - All new components
     - Integration between components
     - Edge cases with various input types

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - For larger codebases, optimize the context builder to use more efficient file scanning
   - Consider implementing caching for file contents to speed up relevance scoring

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities

1. **Rule Validation Testing**: Test the updated Cursor rules in different environments to ensure consistent behavior
2. **CI Integration**: Add GitHub Actions workflow for spec validation
3. **Performance Testing**: Test with larger repositories to ensure the context builder performs well
4. **Command Deprecation Notices**: Add clear deprecation notices for commands that have been replaced

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Web UI**: Develop a simple web dashboard for spec visualization and status tracking
2. **Enhanced LLM TDD Flow**: Improve the LLM-driven TDD workflow with more sophisticated reasoning checks
3. **PRD Integration**: Enhance PRD parsing to extract more structured requirements
4. **Spec Format Consistency**: Complete the migration from "requirements" to "checks" terminology

### For Future AI Engineers

If you're working on CheckMate, here are the key architectural principles to follow:

1. **LLM as Collaborator**: The core design principle is that CheckMate serves as a framework for LLMs to perform TDD. CheckMate provides the structure and validation but doesn't execute tests directly.

2. **Command Simplicity**: Keep commands focused on a single responsibility. The most important commands are:
   - `list-checks`: Retrieve a checklist
   - `verify-llm-reasoning`: Validate an LLM's reasoning about implementation
   - `gen`/`create`: Generate specs from descriptions

3. **Cursor Integration**: Cursor rules are the primary user interface for CheckMate. Ensure rules remain idempotent and follow MDC format conventions.

4. **User Experience**: Always prioritize clear feedback and understandable error messages. Use progress indicators for long-running operations.

5. **Extensibility**: The system is designed to be extended with new commands and integrations. Follow the existing patterns when adding new functionality.

6. **Spec Format Standard**: Always use the simplified spec format with a `## Files` section listing relevant files. The older `<!-- meta: ... -->` format with file hashes is deprecated. This makes specs more readable for both humans and LLMs.

Remember that the PRD (`memory-docs/prd.md`) and architecture documentation (`memory-docs/architectures.md`) should be updated whenever significant changes are made to ensure they remain accurate references.
