✅ Implemented executeRequirement() function (currently a stub for demo)
✅ Added updateSpec() to mark requirements as passed or failed
✅ Added resetSpec() to reset all requirements to unchecked state
✅ Implemented logRun() for JSONL history in checkmate/logs/
✅ Created src/commands/run.ts with run and next commands

## Step 8 - Affected list
✅ Added findAffectedSpecs() in specs.ts to match changed files to specs
✅ Created src/commands/affected.ts with git diff functionality
✅ Added support for different diff bases (default: HEAD~)
